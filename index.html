    this above cdn link injects react into our project and makes exectuion of react possible.
        React is a javascript library
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
this above cdn link is responsible for the documnet object model manipulation through react-->

<script type="module" src="./src/day4.js"></script>

<!--HERE IN THIS CODE WE CANNOT PUT THE ABOVE EXTERNAL JS FILE LINK TO THIS HTML FILE ABOVE THE S
SCRIPT SRC TAGS OF CDN LINKS,BECAUSE APP.JS USES THE ABOVE TWO CDN LINKS(SO  ORDER IS ALSO IMPORTANT)-->


<!--here in this code react only works in the div tag of id root because in app.js we took that div 
tag as root , it works in the particular part of this code so we can call this as library-->

<!--ALL FRAMEWORKS REQUIRE YOU TO CREATE APP USING THAT FRMAEWORK BUT REACT WORKS IN OUR EXISTING
APPS AS WELL, THERE IS NO NEED OF CREATING ENTIRE APP WITH REACT IF WE DON'T NEED IT CAN ALSO BE
USED FOR SMALL PORTION IN OUR APP WHEREVER WE NEED INJECTING THOSE TWO CDN LINKS.,IT NOT ONLY WORK AS 
FULLPLEDGED FRAMEWORK-->
